# INF655-Midterm
# My aim for the midterm was to make a website that fit all of the requirements laid out in the instructions as well as making it have some of my own branding
# I'm using vite to run the server and the only package I need to download was the create-vite@5.2.3
# The name of the website is Generic's Produce Shop and I sell vegetables at an affordable price
